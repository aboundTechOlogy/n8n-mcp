# Test CI Permission Fixes

This file is created to test the CI permission fixes.

## What was fixed:
1. Added `continue-on-error: true` to steps that might fail due to permissions
2. Wrapped GitHub API calls in try-catch blocks
3. Made benchmark auto-push conditional on main branch pushes only

## Expected behavior:
- Tests should pass even if PR comments can't be created
- Benchmarks should run but not fail if they can't push to gh-pages
- All CI checks should show green when the actual tests pass

This file can be deleted after testing.
