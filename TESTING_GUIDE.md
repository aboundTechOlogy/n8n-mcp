# Testing n8n-mcp with Claude Desktop

## Setup Complete! üéâ

The n8n-mcp server is already configured in your Claude Desktop. The new essentials tools are ready to test.

## How to Test

### 1. Restart Claude Desktop
Close and reopen Claude Desktop to ensure it loads the updated MCP server with the new tools.

### 2. Available Tools to Test

#### New Tools (Test These!)
- **get_node_essentials** - Returns only essential properties (95% smaller)
- **search_node_properties** - Search for specific properties within nodes

#### Existing Tools
- **list_nodes** - List all available nodes
- **get_node_info** - Get full node information (original tool)
- **search_nodes** - Search for nodes by name
- **get_node_documentation** - Get markdown documentation
- **get_database_statistics** - Get database stats
- **list_ai_tools** - List AI-capable nodes

### 3. Test Commands to Try

In a new Claude Desktop conversation, try these:

```
1. "Show me the essential properties for the HTTP Request node"
   - This should use get_node_essentials
   - You'll see only 6 properties instead of 200+

2. "Find authentication properties in the HTTP Request node"
   - This should use search_node_properties
   - You'll see the 3 auth-related properties

3. "How do I make a POST request with JSON data in n8n?"
   - This should use get_node_essentials and show examples

4. "List all available n8n nodes"
   - This uses list_nodes

5. "Show me database statistics"
   - This uses get_database_statistics
```

### 4. What to Look For

‚úÖ **Success Indicators:**
- Responses are much shorter and focused
- Examples are included
- Only essential properties shown
- Search returns specific properties

‚ùå **If Something Goes Wrong:**
- Check if Claude Desktop was restarted
- Look for any error messages
- The server logs are suppressed in production mode

### 5. Comparing Old vs New

Try these to see the difference:

**Old way** (using get_node_info):
```
"Show me ALL properties for the HTTP Request node"
```
- Returns 100KB+ of data with 200+ properties

**New way** (using get_node_essentials):
```
"Show me the essential properties for the HTTP Request node"
```
- Returns <5KB with only 6 essential properties

### 6. Example Workflow Test

Ask Claude to:
```
"Help me create an n8n workflow that:
1. Receives a webhook
2. Makes an HTTP POST request with JSON data
3. Sends the result to Slack"
```

With the new tools, Claude should:
- Use get_node_essentials for each node
- Provide focused configuration
- Include working examples
- Complete the task much faster

## Current Status

‚úÖ **What's Working:**
- n8n-mcp is configured in Claude Desktop
- New essentials tools are implemented
- 82.5% average size reduction achieved
- Examples included for all nodes
- Property search functioning

üìä **Performance Improvements:**
- HTTP Request: 20.5KB ‚Üí 2.6KB (87% reduction)
- Slack: 62.3KB ‚Üí 4.0KB (94% reduction)
- Postgres: 38.3KB ‚Üí 2.3KB (94% reduction)
- Average response time: <50ms

## Troubleshooting

If the tools aren't working:

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** (most common fix)
2. **Check the build**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/romualdczlonkowski/Pliki/n8n-mcp/n8n-mcp
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Test manually**:
   ```bash
   npm start < test-command.txt
   ```

## Next Steps

After testing, consider:
1. Monitoring which properties users ask for most
2. Refining the essential property lists
3. Adding more task-based examples
4. Expanding to more nodes

Good luck with testing! The new tools should make n8n workflow building much more efficient. üöÄ
