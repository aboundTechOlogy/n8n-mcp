# License FAQ

## What is the Sustainable Use License?

The Sustainable Use License is a "fair-code" license that allows free use of the software for internal business purposes and non-commercial use, while restricting commercial redistribution or hosting as a service.

## What can I do with this software?

✅ **You CAN:**
- Use it for your own internal business purposes
- Use it for personal, non-commercial projects
- Modify it for your own use
- Share it with others for free (non-commercial)
- Use it to learn and experiment
- Use it in development and testing environments

❌ **You CANNOT:**
- Host it as a service for others
- Sell it or include it in commercial products
- White-label it for commercial purposes
- Remove licensing notices
- Use it in violation of the license terms

## Is this "open source"?

No, this is "fair-code" or "source-available" software. While you can view and modify the source code, there are restrictions on commercial use that make it incompatible with the Open Source Definition.

## Why use this license?

This license helps ensure the project remains sustainable while still providing value to the community. It prevents large cloud providers from offering the software as a service without contributing back, while allowing individuals and businesses to use it freely for their own purposes.

## Can I use this in my company?

Yes! You can use this software for your company's internal business purposes. You just can't resell it or offer it as a service to others.

## What about enterprise features?

Currently, all features are available under the same license. In the future, some enterprise features may be added under a different license model (similar to n8n's .ee. system), but for now everything is included.

## How is this enforced?

The license is primarily enforced through legal means rather than technical restrictions. Using the software in violation of the license terms means you don't have a valid license and could face legal consequences.

## Can I contribute to the project?

Yes! Contributions are welcome. By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same terms.

## What if I need different terms?

For commercial licensing or custom terms, please contact the maintainers through the GitHub repository.
