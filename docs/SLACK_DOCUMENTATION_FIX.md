# Slack Documentation Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Documentation Fetcher Was Getting Wrong Files
**Problem**: When searching for Slack node documentation, the fetcher was finding credential documentation instead of node documentation.

**Root Cause**: 
- Documentation files in n8n-docs repository are named with full node type (e.g., `n8n-nodes-base.slack.md`)
- The fetcher was searching for just the node name (e.g., `slack.md`)
- This caused it to find `slack.md` in the credentials folder first

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `getNodeDocumentation()` to search for full node type first
- Added logic to skip credential documentation files by checking:
  - If file path includes `/credentials/`
  - If content has "credentials" in title without "node documentation"
- Fixed search order to prioritize correct documentation

### 2. Node Source Extractor Case Sensitivity
**Problem**: Slack node source code wasn't found because the directory is capitalized (`Slack/`) but search was case-sensitive.

**Root Cause**:
- n8n node directories use capitalized names (e.g., `Slack/`, `If/`)
- Extractor was searching with lowercase names from node type

**Fix Applied**:
- Added case variants to try when searching:
  - Original case
  - Capitalized first letter
  - All lowercase
  - All uppercase
- Now properly finds nodes regardless of directory naming convention

### 3. Missing Information in Database
**Problem**: Node definitions weren't being properly parsed from compiled JavaScript.

**Fix Applied**:
- Improved `parseNodeDefinition()` to extract individual fields using regex
- Added extraction for:
  - displayName
  - description
  - icon
  - category/group
  - version
  - trigger/webhook detection

## Test Results

After applying fixes:
- ✅ Slack node source code is correctly extracted
- ✅ Slack node documentation (not credentials) is fetched
- ✅ Documentation URL points to correct page
- ✅ All information is properly stored in database

## Files Modified

1. `/src/utils/documentation-fetcher.ts`
   - Fixed path searching logic
   - Added credential documentation filtering
   - Improved search order

2. `/src/utils/node-source-extractor.ts`
   - Added case-insensitive directory searching
   - Improved path detection for different node structures

3. `/src/services/node-documentation-service.ts`
   - Enhanced node definition parsing
   - Better extraction of metadata from source code

## Verification

Run the test to verify the fix:
```bash
node tests/test-slack-fix.js
```

This should show:
- Source code found at correct location
- Documentation is node documentation (not credentials)
- All fields properly extracted and stored
