- [ ] AI agent workflow setup
- [ ] Template import and validation
- [ ] Workflow execution monitoring
- [ ] Error recovery scenarios

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Node loading speed (< 50ms per node)

- [ ] Validation speed (< 10ms simple, < 100ms complex)
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Memory usage profiling
- [ ] Concurrent request handling

### Load Testing
- [ ] 100 concurrent MCP requests
- [ ] 10,000 nodes in database
- [ ] 1,000 workflow validations/minute

- [ ] Resource cleanup verification

## Testing Quality Gates

### Coverage Requirements
- [ ] Overall: 80%+
- [ ] Core services: 90%+
- [ ] MCP tools: 90%+
- [ ] Critical paths: 95%+
- [ ] New code: 90%+

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] All unit tests < 10ms
- [ ] Integration tests < 1s
- [ ] E2E tests < 10s
- [ ] Full suite < 5 minutes
- [ ] No memory leaks

### Code Quality
- [ ] No ESLint errors
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No console.log in tests
- [ ] All tests have descriptions
- [ ] No hardcoded values

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily
- [ ] Check CI pipeline status
- [ ] Review failed tests
- [ ] Monitor flaky tests

### Weekly
- [ ] Review coverage reports
- [ ] Update test documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmark review
- [ ] Team sync on testing progress

### Monthly
- [ ] Update baseline benchmarks
- [ ] Review and refactor tests
- [ ] Update testing strategy
- [ ] Training/knowledge sharing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- [ ] Mock complexity - Use simple, maintainable mocks
- [ ] Test brittleness - Focus on behavior, not implementation
- [ ] Performance impact - Run heavy tests in parallel
- [ ] Flaky tests - Proper async handling and isolation

### Process Risks
- [ ] Slow adoption - Provide training and examples
- [ ] Coverage gaming - Review test quality, not just numbers
- [ ] Maintenance burden - Automate what's possible
- [ ] Integration complexity - Use test containers

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- Coverage: 80%+ overall, 90%+ critical paths
- Performance: All benchmarks within limits
- Reliability: Zero flaky tests
- Speed: CI pipeline < 5 minutes

### Team Metrics
- All developers writing tests
- Tests reviewed in PRs
